Fresh-made stylesheets for the whole family. üçñ 

Compile sass files to CSS and transform using postcss, all in one command.

WARNING: This project is still early on and may be buggy. 

## Usage

```
Usage:
  sheetloaf [input.scss] [output.css] [OPTIONS]
  sheetloaf <input-directory> <output-directory> [OPTIONS]
  sheetloaf <input-glob-pattern> <output-directory> [OPTIONS] 

Options:
  -v, --version        Print the version of Sheetloaf.
  -w, --watch          Watch stylesheets and recompile when they change.
  -h, --help           display help for command

Sass Options:
  -s, --style <NAME>   Output style. ["expanded", "compressed"] (default: "expanded")

PostCSS-CLI Options:
  --config <LOCATION>  Set a custom directory to look for a postcss config file.
  -u, --use <PLUGIN>   List of postcss plugins to use (will make sheetloaf ignore any config files).
```

Custom parsers/stringifiers are not currently supported. 

## Examples

```
sheetloaf ./scss/style.scss ./css/style.css --style compressed --use autoprefixer
```

Above is an example of transforming a sass file, compressing the output and using the 
postcss plugin autoprefixer to add vendor prefixes. Note that postcss plugins will need
to be installed separately, so to use autoprefixer you'd run:

```
npm install autoprefixer
```

---

You may also specify a glob pattern like so:

```
sheetloaf ./scss/**/*.scss ./css --style compressed --use autoprefixer
```

---

Or a directory (note that this is not recursive):

```
sheetloaf ./scss/ ./css/ --style compressed --use autoprefixer
```

## FAQ

> Can I use this with regular CSS files?

Yes, but you should use [postcss-cli](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-cli) in that case, as you'll be incurring a performance hit for no good reason. This project is intended to simplify the two-step process of rendering Sass files and then transforming the output with PostCSS.

Likewise, if all you're looking for is to compile Sass with no transformations, you can stick with [dart-sass](https://github.com/sass/dart-sass).

> Do all postcss plugins work?

Yes, they should. However custom stringifiers/parsers are not currently supported.
